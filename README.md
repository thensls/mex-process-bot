# Coach Max — MEX Process Bot

AI-powered Slack bot that monitors #mex-sos-text, answers MEX process questions
from your knowledge base, and logs response quality to Airtable for review.

---

## How It Works

1. **Cron trigger** — Railway runs the bot every 5 minutes
2. **Channel poll** — Bot fetches new top-level messages from #mex-sos-text
3. **Question gate** — Claude Haiku classifies whether the message is a genuine
   process question (skips announcements, chatter, etc.)
4. **KB classification** — Haiku identifies which category the question belongs to
   (refunds, shop, feather, etc.) and loads just that KB file
5. **Response generation** — Claude Sonnet generates a response using the KB,
   style guide, and escalation contacts
6. **Thread reply** — Bot posts the response directly in the message thread
7. **Scoring** — If the reviewer later replies in that thread with their own answer,
   the bot scores both responses and logs results to Airtable silently

## Environment Variables

Set in the Railway dashboard under your service → Variables.

| Variable | What it is | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `MEX_BOT_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack bot token | api.slack.com → Your App → OAuth & Permissions |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API key | Anthropic Console |
| `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` | Airtable personal access token | airtable.com → Account → API |
| `MEX_BOT_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` | Airtable base ID (starts with `app`) | Airtable base URL |

## Deployment (Railway)

- **Platform:** Railway (`railway.app`)
- **Trigger:** Cron — every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- **Auto-deploy:** Enabled — any push to `main` branch triggers a new deployment
- **Build:** Docker (`python:3.12-slim`, no external dependencies)

To deploy a change: commit and push to `main`. Railway picks it up automatically
within ~2 minutes. Check the **Cron Runs** tab to confirm the next run fires.

## Slack App

**App name:** Coach Max
**Workspace:** NSLS

**Required scopes (Bot Token):**
- `channels:history` — read channel messages
- `channels:read` — look up channel info
- `chat:write` — post replies
- `users:read` — look up member names
- `files:read` — read file attachments

## How to Update

### Update a knowledge base file
1. Go to `references/knowledge-base/` in the GitHub repo
2. Open the relevant `.md` file (e.g., `shop.md` for shop questions)
3. Edit directly in GitHub or clone locally and push
4. Railway auto-deploys on push — changes are live within ~3 minutes

### Add a new KB category
1. Create a new `.md` file in `references/knowledge-base/` (e.g., `events.md`)
2. In `scripts/channel_monitor.py`, add the slug to `KB_CATEGORIES` list
3. Add a display name to `CATEGORY_DISPLAY` dict
4. Add the slug to the `RESPONSE_SCHEMA` category enum
5. Add a description to the `classify_issue()` prompt
6. Commit and push

### Update the bot's voice or tone
Edit `references/mex-style-guide.md` — controls greeting style, escalation
language, source citation format, and warmth level.

### Update escalation contacts
Edit `references/escalation-contacts.md` — controls who the bot tells people
to contact when it can't answer.

### Update SOPs
Drop `.md` files into `references/sops/` — these are appended to the KB for
every response alongside the targeted category file.

### Rotate credentials
1. **Slack token:** api.slack.com → Your App → OAuth & Permissions → Reinstall app
2. **Airtable token:** airtable.com → Account → API → regenerate
3. **Anthropic key:** Anthropic Console → revoke old key, create new one
4. Update all three in Railway: service → Variables

### Change the reviewer
Update `REVIEWER_USER_ID` in `scripts/channel_monitor.py` with the new
reviewer's Slack member ID (find via: click their profile → More → Copy member ID).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Bot not responding | Cron not firing | Check Railway → Cron Runs tab for errors |
| Bot responding to old messages | State was reset | Normal — bot looks back 5 min on each fresh run |
| Bot skipping a question | `is_question()` gate filtered it | Check Cron Runs log for "Skipping non-question" |
| Wrong KB loaded | Classifier got wrong category | Add more detail to question or improve classifier prompt |
| Airtable not logging | Missing env vars | Confirm `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `MEX_BOT_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` are set |
| Bot repeating itself | State file cleared | Railway ephemeral filesystem — expected on redeploy |
